         summary="Obsolete Gradle Dependency"
         explanation="This detector looks for usages of libraries where the version you are using is not the current stable release. Using older versions is fine, and there are cases where you deliberately want to stick with an older version. However, you may simply not be aware that a more recent version is available, and that is what this lint check helps find."

         category="Correctness"
         priority="4"
         summary="Gradle Dynamic Version"
         explanation="Using `+` in dependencies lets you automatically pick up the latest available version rather than a specific, named version. However, this is not recommended; your builds are not repeatable; you may have tested with a slightly different version than what the build server used. (Using a dynamic version as the major version number is more problematic than using it in the minor version position.)"

         explanation="If an application has more than one locale, then all the strings declared in one language should also be translated in all other languages.&#xA;&#xA;If the string should **not** be translated, you can add the attribute `translatable=&quot;false&quot;` on the `&lt;string>` element, or you can define all your non-translatable strings in a resource file called `donottranslate.xml`. Or, you can ignore the issue with a `tools:ignore=&quot;MissingTranslation&quot;` attribute.&#xA;&#xA;You can tell lint (and other tools) which language is the default language in your `res/values/` folder by specifying `tools:locale=&quot;languageCode&quot;` for the root `&lt;resources>` element in your resource file. (The `tools` prefix refers to the namespace declaration `http://schemas.android.com/tools`.)"

         id="AllowBackup"
         severity="Warning"
         message="On SDK version 23 and up, your app data will be automatically backed up and restored on app install. Consider adding the attribute `android:fullBackupContent` to specify an `@xml` resource which configures which files to backup. More info: https://developer.android.com/training/backup/autosyncapi.html"
         category="Security"
         priority="3"
         summary="AllowBackup/FullBackupContent Problems"
         explanation="The `allowBackup` attribute determines if an application&apos;s data can be backed up and restored. It is documented at https://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#allowBackup&#xA;&#xA;By default, this flag is set to `true` which means application data can be backed up and restored by the OS. Setting `allowBackup=&quot;false&quot;` opts the application out of being backed up and so users can&apos;t restore data related to it when they go through the device setup wizard.&#xA;&#xA;Allowing backups may have security consequences for an application. Currently `adb backup` allows users who have enabled USB debugging to copy application data off of the device. Once backed up, all application data can be read by the user. `adb restore` allows creation of application data from a source specified by the user. Following a restore, applications should not assume that the data, file permissions, and directory permissions were created by the application itself.&#xA;&#xA;To fix this warning, decide whether your application should support backup, and explicitly set `android:allowBackup=(true|false)&quot;`.&#xA;&#xA;If not set to false, and if targeting API 23 or later, lint will also warn that you should set `android:fullBackupContent` to configure auto backup."
